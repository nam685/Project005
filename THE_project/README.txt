Easy way:
Just open a Terminal from the current directory
and launch the "Inscriptions" file by tapying

./Inscriptions

and then the programme is luanched, enjoy !

######## On Windows ######## 
Classic way:
all the classes are in the "Classes/" directory
you have to run the program manually either by:
1. luanch cmd from the current derectory and javac *.java,
    then run MainController by taping java MainController
2. luanch Eclipse and select this folder as project folder,
  then run it in eclipse.
  
######## Advice ######## 
For better experience, try to luanch this prgram on a Terminal
or a CMD because there are a lot of stuff printed on it.
(Eclipse has a small terminal on the bottom of the screen, witch is not optimal)
